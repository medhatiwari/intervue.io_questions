Ash - The Pokemon trainer is trying to get visa to Pokeland. For the visa to be approved, he needs to satisfy the following three criteria:

Solve at least x1 problems on Intervue.io.
Have at least y1 current rating on Intervue.io.
Make his last submission at most z1 months ago.
You are given the number of problems solved by Ash (x2), his current rating (y2) and the information that he made his last submission z2 months ago. Determine whether he will get the visa.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ T ≤ 5,000
20 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 50
1,900 ≤ y1,y2 ≤ 2,100
1 ≤ z1,z2 ≤ 6

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers x1, x2, y1, y2, z1 and z2.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if Ash will get the visa or "NO" if he will not.

EXAMPLE:
Input:
4
20 50 2100 1900 6 6
50 20 1900 1900 5 5
20 20 1900 1900 1 6
27 27 1920 1920 3 3
