Kim Kardashian needs your help! Today, her mission is to sabotage the operations of the evil JSA. If the JSA is allowed to succeed, they will use the combined power of the WQS binary search and the UFDS to take over the world!

But Kim doesn't know where the base is located. She knows that the base is on the highest peak of the Himalayan Mountains. She also knows the heights of each of the N mountains. Can you help Kim find the height of the mountain where the base is located?

CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
0 ≤ height of each mountain ≤ 10^9

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line in each testcase contains one integer, N.
The following N lines of each test case each contain one integer: the height of a new mountain.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each testcase, output one line with one integer: the height of the tallest mountain for that test case.
